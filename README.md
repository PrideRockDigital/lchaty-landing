# lChaty Landing

This repository contains a small static landing page for lChaty with a mailing-list signup form.

Currently the form uses FormSubmit.co as a placeholder. Replace the form `action` or implement a server-side endpoint to capture signups.

Files:
- `index.html` — landing page
- `styles.css` — simple styling

To publish: enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings (deploy from `main` branch) or host on any static site host (Netlify, Vercel, Pages).
