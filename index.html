      <h2>What is lChaty?</h2>
      <p>lChaty is a family-first AI assistant designed to grow with your household. It helps with everyday tasks — from answering quick questions and making grocery lists to reading bedtime stories, helping with homework, and remembering family preferences. Our goal is to build a friendly, trustworthy assistant that everyone in the family can use.</p>

      <h3>Key goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Safe and approachable: language, tone, and features designed for family use.</li>
        <li>Helpful across ages: simple answers for kids, deeper assistance for adults.</li>
        <li>Privacy-first: local-first options and careful data practices so families control their data.</li>
        <li>Extendable: plugins and integrations for calendars, shopping lists, and smart home features.</li>
      </ul>
